# Dev Portfolio - Abijin Suvedha A

A responsive, interactive developer portfolio website built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This project showcases my personal profile, skills and projects while demonstrating my ability to build modern, responsive web applications with clean design and performance optimization.

## Objective

To design and develop a fully responsive web portfolio that integrates everything I’ve learned in front-end development — including structure, design, interactivity, and optimization techniques.

### Step-by-Step Project Development
1. Project Setup

      Created a project folder named dev-portfolio.
      
      Added essential files:
      
      index.html  
      style.css  
      script.js  
      /assets (for images, icons, and fonts)
      
      Linked the CSS and JS files to the HTML.


2️. HTML Structure

      Built a semantic HTML5 layout using <header>, <section>, <main>, and <footer> tags.
      
      Created the following key sections:
      
      Header: Fixed navigation bar with logo and links.
      
      Hero Section: Clean introduction with name, role, and a call-to-action button.
      
      About Section: Profile image, bio, and list of skills.
      
      Projects Section: Grid layout showing portfolio projects with hover animations.
      
      Mini-Apps Section: Embedded two JavaScript mini-projects: To-Do List App and Product Filter & Sort.
      
      Contact Section: Functional form with validation and message feedback.
      
      Footer: Social links and copyright info.

3️. CSS Styling and Layout

      Designed a mobile-first responsive layout using:
      
      Flexbox for aligning elements horizontally and vertically.
      
      CSS Grid for displaying projects and portfolio cards.
      
      Created a consistent color palette and typography for a professional look.
      
      Added hover effects, smooth transitions, and animations for interactivity.
      
      Ensured text contrast and button accessibility (WCAG guidelines).

4️. JavaScript Interactivity

      Added dynamic behaviors using Vanilla JavaScript:
      
      Navigation: Smooth scrolling and hamburger toggle for mobile view.

      To-Do List App:

      Add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
      
      Stored data using LocalStorage for persistence.

      Product Filter & Sort:

      Dynamic filtering by category.
      
      Sorting products by price and rating.
      
      Contact Form Validation:
      
      Checked required fields before submission.
      
      Displayed confirmation message after form submission.

5️. Performance Optimization

      To ensure fast load times and smooth performance:
      
      Minimized and combined CSS and JS files.
      
      Used inline critical CSS for faster first paint.
      
      Implemented lazy loading for images.
      
      Reduced HTTP requests by combining icons and reusing CSS classes.
      
      Used optimized images (compressed with TinyPNG).

6️. Cross-Browser & Device Testing

      Tested the web app on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
      
      Verified responsive design on mobile devices and tablets.
      
      Fixed layout and display issues using browser dev tools.

7️. Final Review & Deployment

      Validated HTML and CSS using W3C Validator.
      
      Checked performance via Lighthouse (Google Chrome DevTools).
      
      Uploaded files to GitHub and tested via GitHub Pages / Netlify.
